# 📘 Bases React + TypeScript

This project utilizes **TypeScript** along with React's main hooks, enabling the development of reusable and scalable components. Additionally, it integrates various tools to enhance the development experience.

## 🚀 Technologies and Features

### 🛠️ **React with TypeScript**
- **Main React Hooks**: Uses `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, `useReducer`, and more.
- **Interfaces and Types**: Clearly defines structures and component properties.
- **Custom Hooks**: Implements reusable logic to improve code efficiency.
- **Objects as State**: Utilizes complex structures for managing component data.

### 🎬 **Animations and Effects**
- **GreenSock (GSAP)**: Smooth and dynamic animations.
- **Timelines**: Advanced control over animation sequences.
- **DOM Element References**: Efficient element manipulation using `useRef`.

### ⚙️ **Advanced State Management**
- **Reducers**: Uses `useReducer` to handle more complex states.
- **Action Creators**: Centralizes actions to keep code organized and maintainable.

### ⚡ **Development Tools**
- **Vite**: A fast and optimized development environment for React.

This project is designed to be scalable, efficient, and easy to maintain. 🚀
